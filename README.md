#Idea :- Non invasive Electrical Energy Analysis in realtime
##Theme :- IOT

We are analysing current in realtime without any invasion to electric meter/wires. Our system will be detecting all devices on it's own and also informing about the current ussage by the device in realtime. This system will provide details to curb energy bill also it is useful for security purpose where we can put the complete system in security mode. Where any change in electric current will be informed to Admin/User of the device in realtime. If children are alone at home any heavy use of electric current will notify the parents too. 

Our system use discrete mathematics and waveform analysis to detect devices currently active.

This is system is also useful in areas where one single meter is shared by group of people and dividing electric bill becomes a cumbersome task. Such as PG, Hostels, old shops and rented area in a house.
